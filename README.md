# Introduction

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered "unsinkable" RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

### Goal of the Project
* Understand the Dataset
* Perform Preprocessing on Data
* perfrom exploratory analysis.
* Dataset exploration using various types of data visualization.
* Describe Insights from the data
* Discussion on Modeling

### Conclusion
* It can be seen that most passengers are not survived.
* The percentage of Male passanger is higher than Female
* The average age is approximately 30.The Oldest passanger is near 80 years old and minimum is 0.42 years old. it means may be some are kids and having age less than year.
* The number of female passengers that are survived is higher than male not survived.Male Survival Rate is 13% while female survival rate is 28%.
* The majority of not survived passengers are between 16-30 y.o, quite similar to survived passengers in the same age range. And mostly survived is between 0 to 16 years old
* Most of passengers from both genders prefer to choose 3rd class rather than other classes And majority of the passangers were in Southampton Port.
